Project Abstract:
•    The application is an educational app targeting SFU students who are looking to find school related supplements. Currently students are using the SFU bookstore as a primary source to purchase their supplements and some even use other online communities to find school supplements. This application would help the students to be able to purchase supplements online but it also allows them to sell purchasable items. 

Target:
•    SFU students only.

Situation:
•    Problem: How does SFU students buy/sell used books or any of school supplies? Not by other community websites. 
•    Problem solved currently: 
•    1.) SFU students currently have a Facebook group to sell/buy used textbooks, however, the group page is usually packed with a lot of books unorganized which makes searching for one particular book to be difficult. Also, sometimes students post an item that is not textbooks nor school supplies which creates confusion to the buyers.
•    2.) SFU has a bookstore (in-person and online) which sells both used and new textbook and school supplies. However, the students are limited to purchasing only and no option for selling.
•    Solution:
•    Build a website for SFU students only. The website will be organized by features such as categorization by department, searching tool, ability to decide meet-up location using Google Map API, and etc. 

    
Schema:
•    This application has a main feature of selling/buying textbooks, with some useful sub-features as follows:
1. The books will be organized by its class or department (Categorization) 
2. The posts of sellers will be ordered by time (Sorting)
3. Sellers and buyers can decide where they will meet for trade (Location)
4. Sellers and buyers can hide their private information (Privacy)
5. Sellers can click whether the book is sold or not (Confirming)
6. Sellers can decide the condition of the book (good~bad) (Condition Check)
7. Searching tool
8. Cart feature
9. Review system under the post
10. Sign up, Sign in, Log in, Log out using Facebook login API or Google Login API

11. Report feature
    
Amount of work Enough for 5 members:
 All 5 members are new to the languages currently needed for the group project, therefore, the workload of the project is uncertain.
•    Due to the uncertainty of the workload we have decided to make the application as we have proposed above and in the case of the project scope not being enough for 5 members, we will add additional features to our finished functional application.
•    These additional features include ability to find classroom locations, or bus schedule, or the current location of the buses, or any other features that will help SFU students.
